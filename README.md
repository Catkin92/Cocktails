# Cocktails
A weekend homework made in week 7 of CodeClan. The brief was to make an app that calls an api. This app calls a cocktail api and allows you to search different categories of cocktails and get a recipe by clicking on pictures of different drinks.

## Homework Brief

Your task is to create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

### MVP

- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
- Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

## Project setup
#### Run these instructions:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
