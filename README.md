# Cocktails
A weekend homework made in week 7 of CodeClan. The brief was to make an app that calls an api. This app calls a cocktail api and allows you to search different categories of cocktails and get a recipe by clicking on pictures of different drinks.

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```

### Customize configuration
